        <li>1/4 tsp pepper</li>
        <li>1 tsp sweet paprika</li>

        <li> 1 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Sauce</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 tbsp garlic, freshly minced</li>
        <li> 1/2 cup chicken stock</li>
        <li>300 ml thickened/heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 tsp Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>To Serve</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Mashed potatoes, steamed rice or pasta</li>
        <li> Steamed greens</li>
        <li>1 tbsp parsley, finely chopped</li>
        <li>Lemon wedges</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Sprinkle the chicken with salt, pepper, sweet paprika, onion powder and thyme. Press the chicken into the flour so that all sides are evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil and 1 tablespoon of butter in a large, deep frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook for 5-6 minutes, or until the chicken is just cooked, turning once halfway through.</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken from the pan and set it aside on a plate. </li>
        <li>To the same pan, add the butter for the sauce. Once melted, add the garlic, stirring for 30 seconds. </li>
        <li>Add the chicken stock and cook for 1-2 minutes until it has evaporated by at least half. Stir in the thickened cream and Dijon mustard, reduce the heat to medium, and simmer for 2 minutes until the sauce has thickened slightly.</li>
        <li>Stir through the Parmesan cheese, season to taste, and return the chicken to the pan for 2-3 minutes or until the chicken is heated through. Serve the chicken with rice, mashed potatoes or pasta and a side of steamed greens. Top with freshly chopped parsley and a squeeze of lemon juice. </li>
    </ol>
