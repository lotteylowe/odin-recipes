    <h2>Quick and easy mid-week meal.</h2>
    <p>I love using beef mince/ground beef in my recipes. It’s a low-cost option, the kids happily eat it and it’s so incredibly quick and easy to prepare. This dinner is effortless with the noodles all being cooked in the one pan (because some nights even waiting for water to boil isn’t an option) and it’s a great “catch-all” meal where you can use up whatever veg you have in the fridge. </p>
    <p>Two big handfuls of vegetables are required for this recipe; some great options are bean sprouts, shredded cabbage, carrot, mushrooms, bok choy or baby corn. Aside from being easy, this sauce is outrageously delicious. The hoisin sauce makes it sweet and sticky with a great depth of flavour and if that’s not all wonderful enough, you can have this delicious family dinner on the table in less than 20 minutes!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Sauce</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp dark soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup hoisin sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp mirin</li>

    </ul>
    <h4>Stir Fry</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely sliced</li>
        <li>1 tsp garlic, freshly minced</li>
        <li>500 g beef mince/ground beef</li>
        <li>2 cups broccoli, cut into florets</li>
        <li>1.75 cups water, divided</li>
        <li>200 g thin egg noodles</li>
        <li>1 tbsp corn flour/cornstarch</li>
        <li>2 tbsp tamari or soy sauce (optional)</li>
        <li>1 tsp sesame seeds</li>
        <li>1 spring onion/scallion, finely sliced</li>
    </ul>
    

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the sauce, combine the ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat a large, heavy-based skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the beef mince and cook, stirring for 3-4 minutes until browned, breaking it up with your spoon as you go.</li>
        <li>Add the sauce and cook for 1-2 minutes until caramelised.</li>
        <li>Add the broccoli, place the lid on and cook for 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Push the beef and broccoli mixture to the outside of the pan to make a well in the middle.</li>
        <li>Pour in 1.5 cups of water and add the uncooked noodles to the centre of the pan. Cook, covered, without stirring for 1 minute. Flip the noodles and cook for another 1 minute, covered, or until the noodles are just pliable.</li>
        <li>Using tongs, toss the noodles through the beef and broccoli.</li>
        <li>Combine the corn flour with the remaining 1/4 cup of water.</li>
        <li>Add the corn flour and water mixture to the stir-fry and cook, tossing with tongs for 1-2 minutes or until the sauce has thickened and created a lovely glaze around the noodles.</li>
        <li>Season to taste with the tamari or soy sauce.</li>
        <li>Serve scattered with sesame seeds and sliced spring onions.</li>
    </ol>
